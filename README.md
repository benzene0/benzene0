    >- **Security using Armstrong Numbers and Colors:**  
        â€¢	This is a cascaded cryptography system is an implementation of an IEEE paper.  
        â€¢	Program Operated on two-level.  
        â€¢	This code is Optimized on O(n) from O(n.m^2).  
        â€¢	This Program Designed on Multithreading.
        
    >- **Multi-User Network based Gaming Platform :**  
        A platform that allows multiple users to initiate/join/play a game over the network. The 
        server uses data structures,threads and multiple instances of game to allow clients to 
        play concurrently
        <br/>â€¢	Data Structures: Queues, Hash Tables, LinkedList  
        â€¢ Created Thread Pool for Parallel processing of n clients 
        <br/>â€¢	Networking, Concurrent Programming 
        <br/>â€¢	Peer to Peer connection is established between clients 
        <br/>â€¢	OOP, Interfaces, Multithreading, Datagram Sockets, Singleton, Synchronized method
