    >- **Security using Armstrong Numbers and Colors:**  
        •	This is a cascaded cryptography system is an implementation of an IEEE paper.  
        •	Program Operated on two-level.  
        •	This code is Optimized on O(n) from O(n.m^2).  
        •	This Program Designed on Multithreading.
        
    >- **Multi-User Network based Gaming Platform :**  
        A platform that allows multiple users to initiate/join/play a game over the network. The 
        server uses data structures, (2) threads and multiple instances of game to allow clients to 
        play concurrently
